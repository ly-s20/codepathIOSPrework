**APP PROPOSAL**

My proposed education advocacy app is designed to enhance the traditional classroom experience by providing a seamless channel of communication between students and teachers. Tailored for K-12 education, the app establishes individual profiles for each student, linking them directly to their teacher's interactive dashboard. During lessons, students have the discreet option to click on an “I’m having difficulty understanding this” button and quickly input a summary regarding their challenges. This action sends a confidential notification to the teacher, generating a log of such instances. This feature empowers students to seek help privately and without hesitation. Teachers benefit from an organized overview of these instances, allowing them to identify and track areas where students commonly face challenges. This insight enables educators to refine and adapt their instructional plans to address these pain points, thereby fostering a more effective learning environment. Moreover, the app facilitates a reciprocal interaction. Teachers can respond with positive affirmation by selecting predefined buttons to notify the student that their concern has been acknowledged. This feedback loop assures students that their needs will be met at an agreed-upon time; thus fostering a supportive learning atmosphere. Ultimately, my education advocacy app aims to enable personalized assistance without the fear of embarrassment.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

** While building my app, my greatest challenge was being completely new to navigating Swift, which resulted in a bit of a learning curve about how to implement features and even organize the many windows. Another challenge I faced was the simulator opening then crashing, which I eventually figured out was a result of various errors in my code that did not make the build unsuccessful, but did not correctly connect the functionality to the button I was trying to program.
